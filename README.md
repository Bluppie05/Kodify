# Kodify
The new opensource mediaplayer operating system for Raspberry pi, Orange pi and more

Kodify is the new opensource mediaplayer to turn your Raspberry pi / Orange pi into an smart tv.
We based everything on Armbian so we can make versions for almost every single SBC(Single Board Computer) out there and we are even planning to enter the world of x86 and make an x86 version of Kodify so you can enjoy it on every computer out there.
